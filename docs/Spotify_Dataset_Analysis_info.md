#### Introduction 
Welcome to the Spotify CSV Dataset exploration project! In this repository, we dive into the fascinating world of music data provided by Spotify. The goal is to gain insights into audio features, artist popularity, and track attributes to better understand what makes music resonate with listeners.

#### Project Overview

In this project, we leverage the power of Pandas for data manipulation and analysis, along with Matplotlib for data visualization. We explore the Spotify dataset, aiming to derive meaningful patterns and trends in audio features and artist attributes.

#### Key Features

- Utilizing Pandas for efficient data manipulation and analysis.
- Leveraging Matplotlib for visualizing audio features, artist popularity, and more.
- Exploring audio features to understand musical characteristics that define tracks.

#### Analysis Overview

In this analysis, we focus on several key aspects:

- Exploring audio features such as danceability, energy, valence, etc.
- Analyzing artist popularity and its relation to track attributes.
- Visualizing trends and patterns to understand musical preferences.

#### Data Sources

The dataset employed in this project includes the various track record,artist data,genre of tracks,audio profiling and various aspects of playlist to get info about dataset.

> The Spotify dataset is provided in CSV format and can be accessed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hee34cVx8ydYwEOJKAZ6th74YMzW9Ykz/view) or inside the dataset [directory](../data/processed/Spotify%20Top%20100%20most%20Streamed.csv)

#### Libraries Used

The analysis is conducted using the following Python libraries:

`Pandas:` For data manipulation and analysis.
`Matplotlib:` For creating insightful visualizations.

#### Getting Started

To start exploring the Spotify CSV dataset using Pandas and Matplotlib, follow these steps:


1. Clone the Repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Sumit-SC/Python-Fundamentals.git
```

2. Navigate to the Project Directory:
```sh
cd python-fundamentals/notebooks
```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
- Use [Jupyter Notebook](../notebooks/Exploring%20Spotify_dataset%20using%20Pandas%20&%20Matplotlib.ipynb) to run the provided notebooks for data analysis and visualization.

#### Suggestions

Feel free to customize the analysis based on your specific interests and objectives. Additionally, consider exploring other data visualization libraries and techniques to gain further insights and enhance the analysis.

As a beginner to data science & analytics field i am bound to make silly mistakes in my code or can improve a lot on my visualization , if anyone wants to add a suggestion they can create an issue to point my mistakes.
