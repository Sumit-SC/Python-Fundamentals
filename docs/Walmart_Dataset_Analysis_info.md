#### Introduction 
Walmart, being one of the largest retail chains in the world, generates vast amounts of data encompassing sales, customer behavior, store performance, and more. Exploring and understanding this data can provide valuable insights into consumer trends, seasonal variations, and the effectiveness of various strategies employed by Walmart.

#### Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze the Walmart dataset, extracting meaningful insights and visualizing the data using Seaborn. Exploratory Data Analysis allows us to understand the data's structure, patterns, and relationships, which can aid decision-making and further analysis.

#### Key Features

- Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Walmart dataset.
- Leveraging Seaborn to visualize data through various plots, including bar plots, scatter plots, box plots, pair plots, heatmaps, and more.

#### Analysis Overview

In this analysis, we focus on several key aspects:

<b>Sales Trends:</b> Understanding sales patterns over time, identifying peak sales periods, and exploring seasonality effects.
<b>Customer Behavior:</b> Analyzing customer shopping behavior, preferences, and trends to optimize marketing strategies.
<b>CPI Analysis:</b> Evaluating the The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure that examines the weighted average of prices of a basket of consumer goods and services, such as transportation, food, and medical care to get a view of stores performance.

#### Data Sources

The dataset employed in this project includes the sales data,holiday season store performance, unemployment rates, fuel prices ,CPI and various other data of Walmart for reference analysis.

#### Libraries Used

To accomplish the analysis and visualization, we use the following Python libraries:

`Pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis.
`NumPy`: Numerical computing and arrays.
`Matplotlib`: Data visualization.
`Seaborn`: Statistical data visualization.

#### Getting Started

To replicate this project and conduct your own EDA on Walmart dataset using Seaborn, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Sumit-SC/Python-Fundamentals.git
```

2. Navigate to the Project Directory:
```sh
cd python-fundamentals/notebooks
```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
- Use [Jupyter Notebook](.) to run the provided notebooks for data analysis and visualization.

#### Suggestions

Feel free to customize the analysis based on your specific interests and objectives. Additionally, consider exploring other data visualization libraries and techniques to gain further insights and enhance the analysis.

As a beginner to data science & analytics field i am bound to make silly mistakes in my code or can improve a lot on my visualization , if anyone wants to add a suggestion they can create an issue to point my mistakes.
